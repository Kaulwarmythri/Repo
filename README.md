# SimonGame
This website is a clone of the Simon game, which is an electronic game of memory skill.
It creates a series of tones and lights and requires a user to repeat the sequence.
If you succeed, the series becomes progressively longer and harder.
If you fail, the game is over & you gotta start from Level-1 again.
